            <p className="my-4 md:text-lg leading-relaxed font-dm-sans">BDJJ strongly aligns with public recreation as both foster a climate where individuals can experience pursuits that enhance individual and community wellbeing (CPRA, 2016). BDJJ is a new and emerging approach to complement EDI and this project will add to its operational understanding in Participatory Action Research driven social innovation (Van Der Velde et al., 2009). In addition, the concepts embodied in BDJJ are like 'care-based approaches' in government relationships with the public (Dong & Morehouse, 2022), where practitioners apply strategies such as openness, empathy, and humanization. BDJJ humanizes the process of pursuing EDI strategies and goals. This study explores how the Belonging, Dignity, Justice, and Joy (BDJJ) framework can enhance equity in public recreation.</p>
